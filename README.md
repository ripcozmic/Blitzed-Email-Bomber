# Blitzed Email Bomber

### *Features :*
> - [x] *Literally just spams an email, obviously*

## Installation

- Make sure you have python installed on your pc. 
- [Python3.7.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3712/) or higher (except [Python3.12.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3120/), it's shit)

## Usage
- Use `python main.py` or run it manually by double clicking.
- You will need to create gmail accounts, as this ONLY works with gmail, but easily modified to support another smtp server, then you will need to setup app passwords on them.

## Help
- Why would you need help with this ??
- You can add me on discord, `punchmadecozmic`
